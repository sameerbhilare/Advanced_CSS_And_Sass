        Header-Row section is divided into 2 parts, header and realtors.

        However this section is going to be full-bleed section, so we can make use of the additional 2 columns.
        Hence the first part (header) will span from full-start till end of column 6 (which is also start of column 7)
        And the 2nd part (realtors) will span from end of column 6 (which is also start of column 7) till full-end.
