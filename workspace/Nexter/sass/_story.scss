        Story section is divided into 2 parts, Story Picture and Story Content.
        Of the total 8 columns, We want the Picture to span 4 columns and realtors to have 4 columns.
        However this section is going to be full-bleed section, so we can make use of the additional 2 columns.
        Hence the first part (Picture) will span from full-start till end of column 4 (which is also start of column 5)
        And the 2nd part (Content) will span from end of column 4 (which is also start of column 5) till full-end.
