       We want the label to be hidden and not the input. 
       But label is not child of input element, but it is a sibling of input element.
       '+' which means Adjacent sibling.
           Adjacent sibling is just a sibling that comes immediately AFTER the element that we select in the first place.
           We just need to make sure that the sibling that we have to select always has to be AFTER the first element.
           So in this case, the label needs to be AFTER the input element, otherwise it won't work.
       '~' means any general sibling selector, so this one works if there are more levels in-between those 2 elements.

       Luckily we have pseudo-class :checked on the radio input element to style our trick.
       Otherwise we ould have to write event handler for the radio button events. 
       
       <input type="radio" class="form__radio-input" id="small" name="groupSize">
        <label for="small" class="form__radio-label">

        so when form__radio-input, we want to get sibling form__radio-label and then get child of that
        which is form__radio-label and then we want to style its ::after pseudo element.

        So as soon as we hit the label element, the radio-input becomes checked.
        And what we do then is to simply select the sibling of that one, and then the child 
        because that's the one that we want to change each time that the radio input is selected.
        And we want to give it an opacity of 1.
