/*
    We are implementing "The 7-1 Pattern".
    "The 7-1 Pattern" architecture is really designed to handle large multi-page websites or web apps.
    So maybe for a small landing page like this project, this might seem like a bit too much, a bit overkill.
    But once you start working on a huge project then you'll appreciate how this makes things easier, 
    so it's really important to have an architecture like this in place 
    especially when we're working on a larger project.
